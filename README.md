# FantanoBot

[FantanoBot user profile](https://reddit.com/user/FantanoBot)

This is a basic reddit bot that provides users with album scores from Anthony Fantano's youtube channel [TheNeedleDrop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt7fwAhXDy3oNFTAzF2o8Pw). Operates in [r/fantanoforever](https://reddit.com/r/fantanoforever) and [r/hiphopheads](https://reddit.com/r/hiphopheads).

`!fantanobot [Album Name]` will provide the score for that album (e.g. `!fantanobot The Money Store`).

`!fantanobot [Artist Name]` will list the scores for that artist's albums (e.g. `!fantanobot Kanye West`).

Alternatively, send a private message to the bot with `!fantanobot` as the subject, and the query in the body.
